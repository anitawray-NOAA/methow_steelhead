## Objectives
The overall objective of the genetic component of this study is to understand of the genetic basis of growth, smoltification, and survival in seawater. Specifically, the genetic analyses include the following three components.   
 
1) Estimate heritability for growth and smoltification traits. Heritability is the major factor that determines expected per-generation change in mean phenotype in response to a given selection pressure. This study will help to determine how growth and smoltification are expected to change in response to potential hatchery-induced selection pressures.
 
2) Conduct a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for loci associated with growth, smoltification, and survival through seawater challenge mortality. Identifying loci underlying variation in these phenotypes will help to uncover the developmental, biochemical and physiological pathways through which selection translates into genomic changes over time.
 
3) Use genomic prediction to estimate individual breeding values for growth and seawater challenge mortality. Genomic prediction is a potentially powerful approach to predict phenotypes solely on the basis of genomic data and information on the genetic basis of the phenotypes of interest. We will test the efficacy of genomic prediction methods to forecast growth, smoltification, and seawater challenge, using a leave-one-out, and cross validation methods.
